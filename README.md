## The improvement of gain calibration solution of the MWA ultra-low frequency observation data using winsorized statistics

This repository used for documenting all of the python code for the research. 

#### Abstract

The hyperfine structure, a 21 cm line of the neutral hydrogen at redshift (13 - 17), corresponds to the radio signal within the frequency range 75 - 100 MHz (ex., The Ultra-low Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)). This observation could reveal the neutral hydrogen evolution between the transition of X-ray heating to the reionization. However, other than foreground contaminants, the observations within this frequency range suffer from ionospheric, wide-field conditions, and radio frequency interference (RFI). Therefore, any calibration software will underperform on highly contaminated data, especially due to the RFI.

In this research, we used the newly developed calibration software for MWA data, Hyperdrive, to investigate the contamination at the ultralow band. We attempt to improve the gain calibration solution of the Hyperdrive by detecting outliers on the gain calibration for the specific tile, time blocks, and frequency channelsâ€”the gain amplitude with a z-score of more than \(5\sigma\) identified as RFI contaminants. Meanwhile, the z-score is calculated based on winsorized statistics. The outlier's location is treated as the new flag on the raw visibility data, in addition to the AOFLAGGER. As a result, the gain calibration solution's standard deviation ($\sigma$) was reduced by $68.05\%$, keeping the average change of mean by $2.86\%$, which means the outliers have been reduced by winsorizing. Furthermore, this method adds $1.22\%$ of new flags to the data. After that, the 2D power spectrum and error at $k_{||} > 0.2$ show improvement, $\sim1.5\%$ higher and $\sim10.9\%$ lower on average, respectively. Meanwhile, the S/N also shows 2.6 times better.
